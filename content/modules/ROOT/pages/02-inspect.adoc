IMPORTANT: You will use the bottom terminal called "Second terminal", you will have to copy the command and paste it into the lower terminal window.

In the lower terminal tab of the lab interface, use a `+podman exec+`
command to create an interactive shell inside the running container.

[source,bash]
----
podman exec -t -i $CONTAINER /bin/bash
----

.podmanexec
image::../assets/podmanexec.png[podmanexec]

Check the container’s access to the _/home_ directory

[source,bash]
----
cd /home; ls
----

IMPORTANT: Use the top terminal window

In the top terminal window of the lab interface, query the SELinux policy
to search for allow enforcement rules applied to access _/home_
directory

[source,bash,run]
----
sesearch -A -s container_t -t home_root_t -c dir -p read
----

The search returns NO results. Since, there is no allow rule for
container_t type to get read access to the _/home_ directory, access is
blocked by SELinux.

IMPORTANT: Use the Second terminal window

In the "Second terminal" window of the lab interface, check the container’s
access to the _/var/spool/_ directory

[source,bash,run]
----
cd /var/spool/; ls
----

SELinux is restricting access to the _/var/spool_ directory.

In the "Second terminal" window of the lab interface, check the container’s
write access to the _/var/spool/_ directory

[source,bash]
----
touch test
----

IMPORTANT: Use the top terminal window

In the "terminal" window of the lab interface, query the SELinux policy
to search for allow enforcement rules applied to access _/var/spool_
directory

[source,bash,run]
----
sesearch -A -s container_t -t var_spool_t -c dir -p read
----

The search returns NO results. Since, there is no allow rule for
container_t type to get read access to the _/var/spool/_ directory,
access is blocked by SELinux.

Query the SELinux policy for network access for container_t types

[source,bash,run]
----
sesearch -A -s container_t -t port_type -c tcp_socket
----

Sandbox is the default process type (domain) in SELinux, and container
is the domain used in the context of containers. The corenet type is
typically used in the context of the Linux kernel. The output means that
for each of these domains, binding, connecting, sending and receiving
messages are allowed without TCP port restrictions.
