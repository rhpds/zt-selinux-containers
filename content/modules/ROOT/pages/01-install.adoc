SELinux is a technology to isolate processes/containers running on the
system to mitigate attacks which take advantage of privilege escalation.
Udica is a new tool which complements the containers tools (Podman,
Skopeo, Buildah, etc.) family supported by Red Hat to help improve the
security of customers container environments.

IMPORTANT: This lab assumes that you have a sound understanding of SELinux
basics and container fundamentals.

Prior to getting started, we need certain packages such as Udica (which
is a tool for generating SELinux policies for containers), and
setools-console (which is a set of tools that can facilitate SELinux
policy analysis). In this demo, the container runtime related packages
are already installed.

For the sake of expediency, we'll switch to the root user in the top terminal.

Copy and paste this command into the top terminal to switch to the root user.

[source,bash,run]
----
sudo -i
----

In the top terminal, install the udica and setools-console packages on the container host.

[source,bash,run]
----
dnf install -y udica setools-console
----

Get the latest RHEL9 UBI image

[source,bash,run]
----
podman pull registry.access.redhat.com/ubi9/ubi:latest
----

Use `+podman+` to list the available container images

[source,bash,run]
----
podman images
----

Now we'll use the bottom terminal.

Please switch to the root user.

[source,bash,run]
----
sudo -i
----

Create a container runtime using podman which passes in-container
accesses to /home through to the host’s /home read-only, passes
in-container accesses to /var/spool through to the host’s /var/spool
read-write, and binds the host’s port 80 to pass traffic to the
container’s port 80.

[source,bash,run]
----
CONTAINER=$(podman run -v /home:/home:ro -v /var/spool:/var/spool:rw -d -p 80:80 -it registry.access.redhat.com/ubi9/ubi)
----

IMPORTANT: The home directory is mounted with read-only access, and the
/var/spool/ directory is mounted with read-write access.

Let's go back to the top terminal.

Check the status of the application container using podman and get the
running container id

[source,bash,run]
----
podman ps; CONTAINERID=$(podman ps | grep registry.access.redhat.com | cut -b 1-12)
----

When using SELinux, container processes get assigned a container type
called '`container_t`'.

In the top terminal, verify the SELinux type assigned to the running container.

[source,bash,run]
----
ps -eZ | grep container_t
----

On Red Hat Enterprise Linux, SELinux is enabled by default and in
enforcing mode. You can confirm this by inspecting the output of
`+sestatus+` on the system.

[source,bash,run]
----
sestatus
----

SELinux status: enabled SELinuxfs mount: /sys/fs/selinux SELinux root
directory: /etc/selinux Loaded policy name: targeted Current mode:
enforcing << OUTPUT ABRIDGED >>
